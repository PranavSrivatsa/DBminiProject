The Amusement Park Management System is an application that simulates the working of an amusement park. In this project we've tried to show the day to day activities in a park along with the Statistical analysis of the generated data.\\

The aim of this project is to try and simulate how a real-world park would process large amounts of data and produce information that is meaningful to the owner or/and to the administrator of the park.\\

We have used POSTGRESQL database to store the data generated, Python with the FLASK framework is used process the data from the database send it to the frontend where it is shown in tables and graphs.
